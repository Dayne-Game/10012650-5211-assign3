VSCode has a delightful edit-build-debug cycle, so you don't have to fiddle around as much in your enviroment, which gives you a lot more time porgramming/coding.

VSCode is designed to make coding and debugging easy, and has support for hundreds of different languages. VSCode is based of Electron. Electron is a framework which is used to deploy Node.js for desktop running (Desktop Applications).

Step 1: Press Command-spacebar to open Spotlight and start typing `terminal` than press enter

Step 2: In your terminal to install homebrew copy and paste the command below into your terminal prompt and press enter

`
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" 
`

You will then need to input your computer password (not Apple ID Password) prompt at `Password: ðŸ”‘` (in the terminal). Than wait until homebrew is installed. 

When homebrew is installed you can enter `brew -v` to see its version, by doing this also shows you that homebrew has successfully installed on your computer. Since we now have homebrew installed we can download a whole lot of applications through the terminal. This makes installation quick and easy. You can now go onto Step 2: Installing VSCode.

***When you install Homebrew. Homebrew installs Xcode Command Line tools. Which installs Git, so you don't need to install git.(Git is a requirement for Visual Studio Code) this will be explained in the Git Section***
