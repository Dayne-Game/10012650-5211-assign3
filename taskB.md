# Task B

## Task B1
Visual Studio Code is used for creating websites, native and language-specific programs. VSCode has support for multiple different languages, that you can use to write programs. Such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, C#, Python, C, C++, PHP, Java and Ruby and many many more. You can debug and test most console applications inside VSCode. However you cannot test or debug HTMl inside VSCode (because HTML requires a browser to view). You can install an extention called Live Server which allows you to run your HTML, CSS and JavaScript (Front-End Website) in a server like enviroment using your localhost (127.0.0.1.) address. This extention shows whether your website will run as expected on a server.

## Task B3
The debugger in VSCode only shows output not input. To debug a console application that takes user input you need to change "console": "internal terminal" to "console": "external terminal". This will output the program through the macOS terminal when debugging.

To add break points to your program hover your mouse cursor over the line you would like to add your break point. Select the circle on the left of the line number.
