## Task B
Visual Studio Code is used for creating websites, native and language-specific programs. VSCode has support for multiple different languages, that you can use to write programs. Such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, C#, Python, C, C++, PHP, Java and Ruby and many many more. You can debug and test most console applications inside VSCode. However you cannot test or debug HTMl inside VSCode (because HTML requires a browser to view). You can install an extention called Live Server which allows you to run your HTML, CSS and JavaScript (Front-End Website) in a server like enviroment using your localhost (127.0.0.1.) address. This extention shows whether your website will run as expected on a server.
